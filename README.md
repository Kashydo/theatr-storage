<p>Welcome to the Theatre Warehouse project! üé≠üì¶</p>
</div>

##Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a relational database system for storing theatrical props (costumes, props, stage furniture, etc.) along with a user interface. Having worked in the theatre industry, I noticed a lack of efficient inventory management software, particularly for costumes.

Technologies Used
--
Programming Languages: C# (for the user interface) and SQL (for the database).
Database Management System: SQL Server (or any other SQL-compatible database).

Features
--
- Add, Remove, and Modify Items: Users can add, remove, and modify items in the inventory.
- Print Inventory Sheet: Generate inventory sheets for tracking purposes.
- Print Disposal Sheet: Create disposal sheets for items that need to be removed from inventory.
- Attach Photos: Attach photos of items for visual reference.
- Print Barcode Labels and Tags: Generate barcode labels and tags for easy identification.

Database Structure
--
The database includes the following fields:
- Type: Indicates the type of item (costume, set piece, prop).
- Costumes: Further categorized into female, male, headwear, wigs, shoes, etc.
- Play: Associated play or production.
- Year: Year of the production.
- Actor: Actor assigned to the item.
- Quantity: Number of items available.
- Unit Price: Cost per item.
