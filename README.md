Welcome to the Theatre Warehouse project! üé≠üì¶

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a relational database system for storing theatrical props (costumes, props, stage furniture, etc.) along with a user interface. Having worked in the theatre industry, I noticed a lack of efficient inventory management software, particularly for costumes.

Technologies Used
Programming Languages: C# (for the user interface) and SQL (for the database).
Database Management System: SQL Server (or any other SQL-compatible database).
Features
Add, Remove, and Modify Items: Users can add, remove, and modify items in the inventory.
Print Inventory Sheet: Generate inventory sheets for tracking purposes.
Print Disposal Sheet: Create disposal sheets for items that need to be removed from inventory.
Attach Photos: Attach photos of items for visual reference.
Print Barcode Labels and Tags: Generate barcode labels and tags for easy identification.
Database Structure
The database includes the following fields:

Type: Indicates the type of item (costume, set piece, prop).
Costumes: Further categorized into female, male, headwear, wigs, shoes, etc.
Play: Associated play or production.
Year: Year of the production.
Actor: Actor assigned to the item.
Quantity: Number of items available.
Unit Price: Cost per item.
How to Use
Database Setup: Set up the SQL database using the provided schema.
Run the User Interface: Execute the C# program to launch the user interface.
Perform Actions: Use the interface to add, remove, modify items, print inventory/disposal sheets, attach photos, and print barcode labels/tags.
Example Interface
